# APAC Leaderboard Router

[Hack Club APAC Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.hackclub.com) is a leaderboard for all Hack Clubs in the Asia Pacific and African region!

Each page on the leaderboard has its own club page, which has its logo, custom cover image, team list, and a [scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com) like gallery wall!

A lot of clubs are using this page as their landing page to share with new members and other people!

> **This router allows them to redirect their Hack Club subdomain to their respective club's page on the leaderboard!**

example: [https://cgc.hackclub.com](https://cgc.hackclub.com) points to Hack Club CGC's club page on the leaderboard!

This allows the club to have its own landing page on a custom domain!

The following links have been configured via this router:
1. [https://cgc.hackclub.com](https://cgc.hackclub.com)
2. [https://kjcmt.hackclub.com](https://kjcmt.hackclub.com)
1. [https://byteclub.hackclub.com](https://byteclub.hackclub.com)
1. [https://uet.hackclub.com](https://uet.hackclub.com)
